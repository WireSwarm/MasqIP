## MasqIP Studio v0.2.0

- Expanded the IPv4 Insight Panel into a multi-entry workflow with per-field insight cards, Route Summarizer keyboard ergonomics, and unique IDs for every rendered element.
- Added bare IPv4 support so single-host lookups produce full insights without requiring an immediate CIDR suffix.
- Introduced contextual collapse controls that appear once at least two entries are valid, with automatic collapsing of previous panels as focus advances.
- Refined auto-advance logic to trigger only after two digits follow the CIDR slash, preventing premature focus jumps.
- Improved visual spacing between inputs and their insight cards for clearer hierarchy and scannability.
