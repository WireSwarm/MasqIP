You need to create an icon according to the following description:
The icon represents a tree-like symbol:
A vertical stem extends from the top to a central node.
From this node, two diagonal branches extend downwards to the left and right.
Each branch ends with a segment: the branch pointing upwards ends with a disk, and the two branches pointing downwards both end with squares.
Please create this logo in SVG format.
This logo typically evokes ideas of connection, hierarchy, network, or tree structure (such as in graphs, Git trees, or dependency diagrams).
