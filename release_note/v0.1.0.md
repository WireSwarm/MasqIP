# MasqIP Studio v0.1.0

## Highlights
- Introduced the **MasqIP Studio** shell with three primary IPv4 utilities presented in a glassmorphism Material Design layout.
- Added the **Hierarchical IPv4 Plan** (JLD VLSM) calculator with dynamic subnet sizing, automatic field expansion, and live allocation feedback.
- Delivered the **Route Summarizer** for aggregating multiple CIDR blocks into the smallest enclosing prefix with instantaneous recomputation.
- Built the **IPv4 Insight Panel** featuring the specification-aligned progress bar, exhaustive network statistics, and address-type/class detection backed by an internal lookup table.
- Centralised reusable IPv4 math helpers (conversion, parsing, masks, range typing) powering all calculators.
- Fixed the empty-state crash in the VLSM calculator by guarding the pending state before formatting numeric results.

## UX & Styling
- Applied Material 3-inspired palette with black + purple focus, glass panels, subtle motion, and responsive column layout.
- Added micro-interactions: card hover lift, animated progress indicator, and focus affordances for inputs.

## Testing
- `npm run build`

## Known Follow-ups
- Extend IPv6 feature parity as outlined in the “Cahier des charges”.
- Persist calculator inputs in localStorage to keep planning context across sessions.
