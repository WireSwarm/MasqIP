# MasqIP Studio v0.1.1

Changes since v0.1.0 (`91a0815`).

## Highlights
- Added a second **Hierarchical IPv4 Plan** workflow (“Path plan”) that splits a supernet into labelled dimensions and computes the remaining host space, generated template, and leaf network metrics.
- Expanded the host-driven VLSM method with inline multipliers, automatic field management, and collapsible allocation groups so large plans remain readable.
- Refined the **Route Summarizer** to accept mask-less IPs, autofill missing prefixes from the first CIDR, and document the inherited mask so batch entries are simpler to manage.
- Upgraded the **IPv4 Insight Panel** with richer progress feedback, clickable host suffixes, and a boundary-octet display that exposes the “multiple of eight + remainder” mask breakdown.

## UX & Interactions
- Normalised every calculator’s inputs to keep exactly one trailing empty row, added keyboard navigation (Enter/Backspace) between rows, and ensured focus jumps to the next actionable field.
- Removed the obsolete “Reset plan” ghost button per the latest specification while keeping accent button styling available for future flows.
- Adapted the path-plan leaf size input to honour the 256-address default without pre-filling the field, keeping the placeholder visible as requested.

## Bug Fixes
- NET/BRD labels in the insight progress bar now surface the precise host suffix of the network and broadcast addresses, matching the examples in the spec.
- Boundary-octet guidance drops the arrow adornment, replacing it with the newly required `X+Y` prefix decomposition to avoid misinterpretation.
- Guarded path-plan calculations against oversubscription of host bits, delivering actionable validation errors before misaligned plans are produced.

## Testing
- Not run (UI-only and arithmetic changes pending manual verification).

## Known Follow-ups
- Align the IPv6 tooling with the IPv4 feature set described in the Cahier des charges.
- Persist calculator state in-browser so complex planning sessions survive reloads.
