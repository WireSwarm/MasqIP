- Adjust the style and dimensions of the progress indicator.
- Remove the "insight-legend".
- Ensure that "insight-grid" displays two columns even for slightly smaller screens (adjust the threshold).
## Hierarchical IPv4 Plan - Method 2
- Align all elements of type "Readable: Yes" to the left.
- Place the "layer breakdown" element above the "Address Explorer".
## Hierarchical IPv4 Plan - Method 1
- Ensure that the multiplier-input never exceeds the visible border.
# Design
The logo must be horizontally aligned with the main title.
